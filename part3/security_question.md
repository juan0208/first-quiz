**Authentication and Access Control (A2 and A4):**

- Ensure that authentication and access control are robust in your system. Implement strong authentication and proper authorization to ensure that each employee has access only to the information and functionalities necessary for their tasks.

**Protection of Sensitive Data (A3):**

- Ensure that sensitive customer data, such as passwords and personal information, is stored and handled securely. Implement secure storage techniques, such as password hashing and salting.

**Exposure of Sensitive Data (A7):**

- Avoid exposing confidential customer information to employees who do not need it to perform their functions. Control and restrict access to this information.

**Security in Development (A9):**

- Foster best practices for secure development within your engineering team. Conduct code reviews and security testing to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the code.

**API Security (A1):**

- If your system uses APIs for component interaction, ensure that these APIs are protected, and that authentication and authorization are strong to prevent unauthorized access.

**Session Management (A2):**

- Securely manage user sessions, especially in the web application and mobile application. Prevent session hijacking and protect authentication and session cookies.

**Network Layer Security (A6):**

- Ensure that communications between your system's components are secure. Use encrypted connections (HTTPS) and protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Security Evasion (A8):**

- Monitor potential security evasion threats and protect your system against attacks such as malicious code injection.

**Incident Detection and Response (A10):**

- Establish an incident detection process and a response plan in case of a security breach. All employees should be familiar with security incident procedures.
